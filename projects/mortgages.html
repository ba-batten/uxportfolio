          SECU will be launching a new online feature allowing customers to more easily apply
          for and obtain a mortgage. The organization wants the information for mortgages on the
          marketing website to be improved in an effort to drive more traffic to the new mortgage
          origination feature.
        </p>
        <p>
          A human-centered design approach was used to reimagine how mortgages are presented on
          the website. Users will be able to more easily find relevant information about the
          various mortgage products offered and then begin an application.
        </p>
        <p>
          I served as the lead designer on the project. I led efforts to conduct research and
          usability testing that influenced the design. This project is currently in a review
          and finalization process before going live on the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          SECU is concerned about liability exposures and limited how much I could contact
          potential users. I had to use online testing and research methods to get the information
          necessary to drive design decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to gain insight into the information most relevant to customers as they
          shopped for mortgages. I contacted several mortgage lenders within the organization
          to discover commonly asked questions. I would have preferred to conduct interviews
          with some of SECU’s customers, but I had to resort to a survey to see what people similar
          to SECU’s membership base would want to know about a mortgage.
        </p>

        <p>
          The information from the lenders and the survey was analyzed to identify the most
          relevant and useful information. Some of the topics identified to be prioritized was
          identifying a suitable mortgage, estimating a potential payment, rates, and easily
          applying for a mortgage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used information from my research to begin generating ideas and creating low-fidelity
          wireframe sketches. Mortgage information on the website is currently organized by rate
          structure. There are pages for adjustable rates, fixed rates, and then a page for
          specialized mortgages like construction loans and mobile homes. A lot of the information
          on those pages are duplicated. I decided to consolidate the redundant information to
          a single page. Based on my research, I wanted to include a tool where users could
          identify the best mortgages for them as well as utilize a payment calculator. Rates
          for popular mortgage products also needed to be displayed. More unique and specialized
          information could be placed onto secondary pages easily navigated to from the main mortgage page.

          Once a rough design was in place, I began usability testing. I was not permitted to bring
          testers on site, so I utilized Maze.design for testing. I wanted to test the individual
          functional components separately and then test the whole design. I put each component through
          multiple rounds of testing and then used the feedback to make improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
          The concept presented for approval is based on using a central page with the most
          relevant information a user would need. There will be additional pages with more specific information.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main page would present users with a strong call to action. Many users already know they want to apply for a mortgage and need this function to be found easily. The page will also feature a tool allowing users to input information about the home they need to finance and they will be given a list of appropriate mortgage options. Rates for SECU's most popular mortgage products will be displayed along with the ability to view additional rates or begin an application now. There is also a resource center that will direct the user to other mortgage topics such as a glossary and an affordability calculator. A FAQ section will conclude the main page.

          Initial discovery revealed that many people do not understand common terminology
          used with mortgages, so I decided to add a glossary of mortgage terms complete with a search function.
        </p>

        <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center my-5 p-3 border bg-lightgray glossary">

        </div>

        <p>
          Affordability is another concern of borrowers. I designed and tested a calculator
          that takes user input about their income and financial obligations. The calculator will output a monthly payment the borrower can afford and then a list of mortgages
          that may be of interest to the user.
        </p>

        <div class="w-100 d-flex flex-column flex-lg-row flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center my-5 p-3 border bg-lightgray">

          A project of this nature for a financial institution must go through several approvals before it can go live. That is where this project is currently. Verbiage on the pages is being reviewed and finalized by the lending and compliance departments. The review process can also alter the functionality of the design as upper management sees fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest challenge of this project and many others is the limitations placed on
          designers in terms of contacting outside sources for interviews and testing. I was able
          to work around them using alternative methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The anticipated results of this design project will benefit both the organization and the
          users. The users will be able to more easily learn about and apply for mortgage products.
          The organization should see an increase in mortgages originated online.
