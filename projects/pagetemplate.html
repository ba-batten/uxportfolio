        <p>SECU maintains a marketing website and an online portal for members to view account information
          and perform transactions. There is a disconnect between the products described on the marketing
          site and the portal to apply for those financial products. Bridging the gap between information
          and action is a design challenge that had to be addressed.
        </p>
        <p>We utilized a human-centered design approach to create a template maximizing users’ ability
          to connect with the portal allowing them to apply for accounts and loans.
        </p>
        <p>My role was to conduct research, develop designs in collaboration with department heads,
          and then test those designs. This is an ongoing project as the base template design is
          being applied to more products.
        </p>
        <p>Organization policies on contacting members limited me in regards to recruiting users for
          testing. I had to be creative in order to empathize with users, but I entertained a variety
          of methods to gain the insight I needed to complete this project. I sourced testers from
          other departments in the organization as well as people I knew personally.
        </p>
        <p>I began with user interviews and usability tests to understand what motivated
          users to browse the SECU website and what they hoped to accomplish. I also needed to
          identify pain points preventing users from applying for loans and accounts online. Two
          common struggles users experienced became obvious. The first is that call to action was
          difficult to find or missing altogether. Pages were also very verbose and difficult to scan
          for pertinent information about a product. These problems were exacerbated by a poor design
          scaling the website down on mobile devices.
        </p>

        <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center my-5 p-3 border bg-lightgray">
          <h2 class="mb-4">Original Page Template</h2>
          <img src="../assets/original-page-template.png" alt="original page template">
        </div>

        <p>Based on the usability tests, I concluded that users needed to be able to quickly locate
          information for a given product, including the call to action.
        </p>
        <p>In order to begin generating ideas, I reviewed websites of competitors. I wanted to
          see how others were approaching the same problem. I also analyzed e-commerce websites because
          of their ability to encourage users to perform a desired action.
        </p>
        <p>I created a number of sketches to get as many ideas out as possible and then refined
          the best ideas. I validated and refined my best sketches with colleagues in other departments
          as well as with users outside of the organization in order design a page template.
        </p>

        <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center my-5 p-3 border bg-lightgray">
          <h2 class="mb-4">Sketches</h2>

        </div>

        <p>Work began on actual pages once a template was in place. The four products/pages
          identified for the initial implementation of the template were checking accounts, mobile
          app, credit cards, and vehicle loans.
        </p>
        <p>I followed a similar design process for each page. I used a variety of methods to
          gain insight for designing each page. I took advantage of social media posts, online
          forums, blogs, and short interview like conversations with people I came in contact
          with throughout the project. The template was designed to highlight the most important
          features of each product, so I needed to know what was most important to people about
          each product. I collaborated with department heads to generate and streamline the content
          for each page.

        </div>

        <p>The biggest challenge of this project has been sourcing participants to test designs.
          I was able to identify a core group willing to test multiple times enabling me to iterate
          through the design process multiple times. This project has resulted in SECU being able to
          provide it’s members an easier and more clear path to allow them to obtain the financial
          products they need. We saw increases of up to 500% over the previous month for new online applications.
