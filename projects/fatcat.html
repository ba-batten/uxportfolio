            SECU has a financial literacy program for young children called Fat Cat with an accompanying website. The website had become dated and was in need of an UI update. I was tasked by my management to work with the development team to design and deploy an updated Fat Cat website.
          </p>

          <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center my-5 p-3 border bg-lightgray">
            <h2 class="mb-4">Original Fat Cat Site</h2>
            <img src="../assets/old_fatcat_screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of old Fat Cat website" class="img-fluid">
            <p class="mt-4">The original Fat Cat website was very dated and non-responsive.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            I was given creative control over the design with a few requirements from management. The new site needed to include interactive activities and the Fat Cat mascot needed to be reimagined.
          </p>

          <p>
            Among the challenges of this project was SECU's views on user research and testing. I was not allowed to contact any SECU members. I also could not bring anyone on site. I resorted to validating designs with colleages in other unrelated departments, friends and family.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the problems with the original site was the structure. Content was unorganized and difficult to find. I took a content inventory to begin reorganizing. Content on the site largely served two different audiences: children and their parents. I brainstormed with some of the other designers and we concluded the best way to organize the site was to have a section dedicated to each audience that would house relevant content. For the children, we featured fun activities like coloring pages and games. The section for parents contained information for how to help their children save money to meet certain financial goals and life insurance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once the site was organized, I began to work on the visuals. One of the requirements I was given was to redesign the Fat Cat mascot. I worked with the department in charge of marketing through several iterations until we settled on a mascot that lined up with their branding vision. The new mascot featured a flat design and would serve as the visual foundation of the site.
          </p>

          <div class="w-100 d-flex flex-column flex-lg-row flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center my-5 p-3 border bg-lightgray">
            <h2 class="text-center">Mascot Before and After</h2>

              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            In addition to the mascot, I spent a considerable amount of time working with various color schemes based that would work with the orange established in Fat Cat branding. I settled on a light blue that would compliment the orange in addition to a few accent colors.
          </p>

          <div class="w-100 d-flex flex-column flex-lg-row flex-wrap align-items-center justify-content-center my-5 p-3 border bg-lightgray">
            <h2 class="text-center">Color Palette</h2>

              <li class="m-3 text-center" style="width: 75px; height: 75px; background-color: #ffa300;"></li>
              <li class="m-3 text-center" style="width: 75px; height: 75px; background-color: #99badd;"></li>

              <li class="m-3 text-center" style="width: 75px; height: 75px; background-color: #FFFFC7;"></li>
              <li class="m-3 text-center" style="width: 75px; height: 75px; background-color: #05A8AA;"></li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            Typography was a big concern as the site needed to be easily read by a younger audience. SECU’s website uses Nunito as the primary font family so I decided to carry it over to the Fat Cat website for body text. I needed to create a stronger visual hierarchy, and I didn’t feel that Nunito alone did this. I chose Fredoka One for all page titles and subtitles because it was a much bolder font.
          </p>

          <p>
            I knew from studying analytical data for the site that slightly more than 50% of the site’s current users viewed the site from a mobile device. I planned to use a mobile first design philosophy. One of the most obvious flaws of the original site was that it was not responsive and this had to be improved on the new site.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many mobile websites have a navigation bar at that top of the page with a hamburger menu that expands to show various navigation links. I decided to move the navigation to the bottom of the page so that children with small hands could more easily reach the links. I also wanted to keep the main navigation very simple, so it only had three first level links: Home, For Kids, and For Parents.
          </p>

          <p>
            The three pages in the main navigation were to have a similar structure. There would be a fun animation featuring the Fat Cat mascot taking up the top third of the page with links to other pages below. The links on the pages were designed to be large and easily click/tappable.
          </p>

          <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center my-5 p-3 border bg-lightgray glossary">
            <h2 class="mb-4">Overview Page Design</h2>
            <img src="../assets/forkids.jpg" alt="screenshot of For Kids page">
            <p class="mt-3 text-center">The navigation was placed at the bottom of the screen to facilitate children with small hands reaching the navigation links. The links on the page are large tiles that are also designed to be accessed easily.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            The animations presented a unique challenge. Not only was I the lone designer primarily assigned to the project, I also had to create all graphical assets. I spent some time learning animation with Adobe After Effects and then created three primary animations set in a continuous loop. I used the <a href="https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/" target="_blank"><u>Lottie</u></a> plugin to export the animations to an animated SVG. I also wrote the scripts in Javascript needed to get the animations to work on the website.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most intense design was for the content housed in the “For Kids” area. Some of the original content carried over from the original site was an art gallery for coloring contest winners, a newsletter for kids, and desktop wallpapers. I added interactive games and online coloring pages with the new website.
          </p>

          <p>
            The developers and I were able to come up with two initial concepts for the interactive games. A third game was later developed. The first game randomly generated a list of coins and the player had to provide the total value of the coins. The second game asked for a certain value and the player must drag the appropriate coins into an area that equal the requested value. I designed the first two games and then coded the basic logic used for the game. The developers reviewed and refined my code.
          </p>

          <p>
            The third game is more complicated. Players can choose between three difficulty levels. Depending on the difficulty, the user is presented two sets of coins and must choose the higher valued set. Some difficulties are timed to add some pressure. In addition to designing the look of the game, I also worked with a developer to create a flowchart to facilitate development.
          </p>

            <p class="mt-4">User flow developed while mapping out the Comparing Coins activity with a developer.</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            The other new feature added was online coloring pages. Feedback from SECU’s branch network revealed that branch employees would print off coloring pages to entertain children in the branch while their parents were conducting business. The new coloring pages on the site would allow branches to print on-brand coloring pages. Children could also access the same coloring pages from any device and color them digitally.
          </p>

          <p>
            The new site launched with four coloring pages featuring the Fat Cat mascot doing various activities. I also wrote the Javascript for the coloring pages. Users are provided a color palette. The active color is indicated by a dot in the center of the swatch. Users can click on an area of the image and that area is filled with the active color. Users can also undo the previous action, clear the canvas, zoom in and out, and print a PDF version of the coloring page.

            </ul>
          </div>

          <p>
            The pages and content making up the “For Parents” section is mostly text. The same content on the original Fat Cat site had inconsistencies with the verbiage on the main SECU marketing site, so I made some changes to the Fat Cat content to maintain consistency. The biggest design consideration for the pages was establishing a page template. Many people access Fat Cat from the SECU website, so I stuck with a similar page design as that site. I did create a fun image for each page featuring Fat Cat doing something relevant to that page. One example is Fat Cat holding an umbrella on the life insurance page.
          </p>

          <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center my-5 p-3 border bg-lightgray">
            <h2 class="mb-4">For Parents Page Template</h2>

            <p class="mt-4">The text heavy pages found in the For Parents section all follow the same basic template</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            The Fat Cat project was a fun and challenging project. It was fun because I was free to be very creative and make fun colorful designs. It was also a challenge as this was my first project with SECU on this scale. I faced some limitations from SECU in that they do not advocate testing or much user research. I used friends and family as well as colleagues in other departments of SECU to help with some testing and to provide feedback throughout the duration of the project.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, I think the project was a success. The new website now has a responsive mobile first design. It is organized in a way that the site’s distinct audiences can easily locate information and activities. The site also has a much needed modern look. I learned a lot from being the lead designer on a project. The lessons learned on this project will
